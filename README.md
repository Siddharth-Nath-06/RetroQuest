# ⚔️ RetroQuest

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-online-green.svg)](https://siddharth-nath-06.github.io/RetroQuest/)

A gamified productivity application that turns your daily tasks into an epic RPG adventure. Track your quests, earn XP and coins, and level up your life!

## 🤖 AI-Generated Project

This project was built entirely by **Google's Antigravity** agentic coding assistant.

-   **Models Used:** Gemini 3 Pro (High) and Claude Sonnet 4.5
-   **Human Intervention:** Minimal. The human developer only intervened to:
    -   Provide high-level prompts and design direction.
    -   Resolve specific blockers where the models got stuck.
    -   Restore files when data corruption occurred due to failed tool edits.

## ✨ Features

-   **Quest Log:** Create and manage tasks with difficulty levels, tags, and deadlines.
-   **RPG Progression:** Earn XP to level up and Coins to spend in the shop.
-   **Shop System:** Create custom rewards (Snacks, Entertainment, etc.) and buy them with your hard-earned coins.
-   **Quest Master:** An AI-powered assistant (using Gemini) that generates quests for you based on your goals.
    -   Supports **Gemini API** (Cloud)
    -   Supports **Chrome Prompt API** (Local/Experimental)
-   **Data Management:** Export and import your save data (JSON) to keep your progress safe.

## ⚠️ Technical Disclaimers

Please note the following about this project's architecture:

-   **No Backend:** This is a 100% client-side application. There is no server or database.
-   **Local Storage:** All data (quests, profile, items) is stored in your browser's `localStorage`.
    -   *Warning:* Clearing your browser cache or site data will wipe your progress unless you have exported a backup.
-   **Security:** There are **no security features** or authentication.
    -   API Keys for the Quest Master are stored in `localStorage` and are accessible to any script running on the page.
    -   Do not use this for sensitive data.
